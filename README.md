# E-Commerce-Page
A simple shop page

The shop page should include the following elements:

  •	Product showcase  
  •	Product options  
  •	Product selection  
  •	Order summary (basket)  
  •	Checkout summary  
  •	Checkout system feedback  

The product showcase features a well-organized layout, showcasing product images, titles, descriptions, and prices where users can browse, and purchase products.
The design ensures a smooth and intuitive shopping experience, with clear navigation and visually appealing product display.

Each product listing includes an "Add to Cart" button, allowing users to select items they wish to purchase.

To proceed to checkout, users must select at least one product. A validation message prompts users to select items if they attempt to proceed without making a selection.

The checkout section is where users finalize their purchases and provide necessary information for order processing like their personal details, contact information, and shipping address.

Mandatory fields are clearly indicated, ensuring users provide essential information to complete the order. The form includes validation checks to verify that required fields are filled in correctly. Incorrectly filled fields are highlighted to prompt users for correction.

Once all required information is provided and validated, users can proceed to complete their purchase.

The system provides a message to confirm the completion of the order.
